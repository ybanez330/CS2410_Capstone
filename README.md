## Introduction:</br>
Using Python and packages such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we will be doing mathematical and statistical analysis on the dataset we have found. We will be looking at a summary of the basic statistics of the data, a heatmap correlation graph, different types of plots, and histograms of each of the individual factors to understand and visualize the relationship between the different factors that are important or contribute to Type 2 Diabetes.</br>

## Explored Questions:</br>
What is the correlation between listed factors and the diagnosis?</br>
Are some factors more important or impactful than other factors?</br>
Can we use the factors and frequency to predict if someone is more likely to have diabetes or not?</br>
What can we look at to control and limit how many people get diabetes (especially within this population?</br>
</br>

## Code:</br>
In the Capstone_Vis.py file you'll find code that pertains to the Visualizations used for our Data Analysis.</br></br>
This code will include 6 pieces of code to generate the following: </br>
    1. A basic stats table to show the: Mean, Standard Deviation, Min, Quartiles, and Max. </br>
    2. Heat Map to show the correlation between the given data set columms.</br>
    3. Linear Regression plot between Insulin and Glucose.</br>
    4. Subplot for all Histograms of each columns showing wach column and the comparison between who does and does not have diabetes in that category. </br>
    5. Scatter plot between Glucose and Blood Pressure. </br>
    6. Pie Chart to show patients within a range of percentages who were predisposed and more likely to have diabetes based on family history (Diabetes Pedigree Function).</br></br>
